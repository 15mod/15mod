TODO

shadow LODs MUST be remade/fixed because current ones have awful clipping and very low detail
wreck is missing, damage rvmats are in place but it might use a proper wreck or damagehide selections
internal glass when damaged appears barely different from normal glass, textures work regularly though
inverse kinematics animations requires minor remodeling and proxy alignment
check passenger/pilot animations -> cargo anims will be switched to uh60 ones when that is done
interior lights -> find something suitable, collision lights clip through the model and appear on the exterior model too like halloween pumpkins
roadway LOD has been disabled because it messes up the slingload function, do not re-enable without testing first
altimeter isn't working correctly, for some reason in buldozer it works right, but in game it works the opposite way
