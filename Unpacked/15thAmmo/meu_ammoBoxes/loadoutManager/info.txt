// 15th Loadout Manager 2
// Fight9
// built on Riouken's framework


Keys:
Double Click on saved loadout - see saved items
CTRL + Double Click on saved loadout - rename loadout
SHFT + Double Click on saved loadout - make it a favorite
DEL key won saved loadout - delete loadout
CTRL + Click Save - quick save loadout with same name

Fixes:
- black images
- random hint errors
- RPT error on usage
- loaded magazines not saving
- some goggles not loading
- assigned radios not loading
- packed weapons attachments/mags not saving
- invisible backpack items
- loaded designator battery not saving
- loaded ear buds not saving

New:
- view saved gear
- rename loadouts
- default loadouts
- quick save
- freakin favorites!
- save TFAR freqs on assigned radio - loads on all radios
- add manager to any non-15th box with ( ["init",[box]] spawn meu_fnc_manager )
- can disable "gear in box" check ( box setVariable ["meu_boxRestrictions",false] )
- better initialization
- better organization
- better optimisation
- better error messages
- super sexy GUI

Notes:
- Laser Designators will have loaded battery saved if you have any extras in your outfit containers
- Packed weapons will have attachments/loaded mags saved but loaded seperately (the method of adding them was too hacky)
- Radio presents are saved from assigned radio and backpack radio only (loaded on all radios, though)

Known Issues:
- Saved radio presents are not displayed in "Current Gear" right away after loading a loadout (takes TFAR a few seconds to convert your radio)

Future Plans:
- Option to remove default loadouts from scroll actions and to add favorite system to them as well
